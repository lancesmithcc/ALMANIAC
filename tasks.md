## Progress Status
üö® **DATABASE COLUMN ISSUE IDENTIFIED & FIXED:** Created fix-db API route to add missing user_id columns!

## Recently Completed
‚úÖ **Database Column Fix:** Created `/api/fix-db` route to add missing user_id columns to existing tables
‚úÖ **Setup Page Enhanced:** Added "Fix Database" button for repairing existing database tables
‚úÖ **Production Database Issue:** Identified that tables were created without user_id columns
‚úÖ **Build Errors Fixed:** Resolved React unescaped entities errors in setup page
‚úÖ **Database Repair Tool:** Complete solution for fixing production database schema

## Current Issue Identified & Resolved
üîß **ROOT CAUSE:** The database tables in production were created from an older version of init-db that didn't include user_id columns.

**SYMPTOMS:**
- "Unknown column 'user_id' in 'where clause'" errors
- Plants page shows "Failed to load plants"
- AI insights show "Failed to fetch recommendations"
- All user-specific data queries failing

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
‚úÖ Created `/api/fix-db` route that adds missing user_id columns to existing tables
‚úÖ Updated setup page with "Fix Database" button for easy repair
‚úÖ Added proper error handling for existing constraints
‚úÖ Build passes all TypeScript validation

## Next Steps for User
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Commit and push changes to trigger new Netlify deployment
2. **AFTER DEPLOYMENT:** Go to https://almaniac.lancesmith.cc/setup
3. **CLICK:** "Fix Database" button to add missing user_id columns
4. **TEST:** Plants and AI insights should work after database fix
5. **VERIFY:** All app features work with authenticated users
